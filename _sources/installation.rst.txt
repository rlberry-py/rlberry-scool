Installation
============

First, we suggest you to create a virtual environment using either `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ (included in python) or `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_.

- Venv
.. code:: bash

    python -m venv rlberry_environment
    source rlberry_environment/bin/activate

- Conda
.. code:: bash

    conda create -n rlberry
    conda activate rlberry

Then, once inside the virtual environment, you can install rlberry-scool with the following:

.. code:: bash

    pip install rlberry-scool
